\section{Operating Systems: Definition and Services}

\subsection{What is an Operating System?}
An \textbf{operating system (OS)} is an intermediary between computer hardware (memory, processor, network cards, etc.) and the applications that users interact with.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Users interact with applications.
    \item Applications request services from the operating system.
    \item The operating system manages and exploits hardware resources to provide services to the applications.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Examples of Operating Systems}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Microsoft Windows
    \item Apple macOS and iOS
    \item Google Android
    \item Unix and Unix-like systems such as Linux
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Unix and Linux}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Unix has been around longer than Linux.
    \item Linux is a \textbf{Unix-like, open-source operating system}. The Linux kernel, created by \textbf{Linus Torvalds} and expanded upon by thousands of programmers, is available to the world for free.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Core Services Provided by an Operating System}

\subsubsection{File Management}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Managing the logical tree structure of files and their physical layout on storage devices (hard drives).
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Memory Management}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Allocation, deallocation, and sharing of memory among multiple running processes.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Process Management}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Creation, execution, and termination of running applications (processes).
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Input/Output Management}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Managing hardware like network interfaces, sound cards, video cards, printers, and other peripherals.
\end{itemize}

\section{Genesis of Operating Systems}

\subsection{Early Computers (Mid-1940s)}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The first computers were built using \textbf{vacuum tubes} (evacuated glass containers that control electric current).
    \item These were huge machines that filled entire rooms but performed more slowly than a modern hand-held calculator.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Programming and Operation}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Programming was done manually by rearranging hardware components.
    \item Input/output capabilities were very limited.
    \item A single individual often acted as the designer, builder, programmer, and operator.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Invention of the Transistor}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The invention of the transistor led to smaller, more reliable computers.
    \item This innovation marked the beginning of operating systems through the appearance of \textbf{punch cards}.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Punch Cards and Role Separation}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Punch cards are cards with holes in specific locations to encode computer programs and data.
    \item This led to a separation of roles: programmers prepared the punch cards, and operators physically loaded them into the computer and handled the output.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Birth of Operating Systems}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Operating systems were invented to manage memory, processes (running programs), and input/output operations like reading punch cards.
    \item We can date the invention of operating systems to the \textbf{mid-1960s}.
\end{itemize}

\section{UNIX Genesis}

\subsection{Technological Context}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The era of modern computers emerged with the appearance of \textbf{integrated circuits} and magnetic disks.
    \item This period also saw the development of compatible computer families, such as the \textbf{IBM System/360} (1964), which made a clear distinction between architecture and implementation.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Project MAC at MIT}
\begin{itemize}
    \item It all started with \textbf{Project MAC} (Mathematics and Computation), founded at MIT.
    \item It was funded by the US military's research agency (ARPA) and the National Science Foundation.
    \item The main goal was to develop a \textbf{timesharing system} that would allow a large community of users to access a single computer from multiple locations simultaneously.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{MULTICS}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Developed by MIT, Bell Labs, and General Electric
    \item Stands for \textbf{Multiplexed Information and Computing Service}
    \item It evolved beyond timesharing to incorporate features like file sharing, file management, and system security.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Challenges of MULTICS}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The project proved much more difficult than expected.
    \item The system became operational in 1969 on the GE-645 computer, but its performance was far below the original targets.
    \item As a result, Bell Labs withdrew from the project in 1969.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Birth of UNIX}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Following the withdrawal, Bell Labs engineers \textbf{Ken Thompson} and \textbf{Dennis Ritchie} decided to create a simpler, minimal system.
    \item Using a little-used DEC PDP-7 machine, they began developing a single-user operating system.
    \item As a pun on the complexity of MULTICS, they called their system \textbf{UNICS}.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Evolution of UNIX}
\begin{itemize}
    \item In 1970, the system was enhanced to support multiple users, and its name morphed to \textbf{Unix}.
    \item At the time, the system was written in the \textbf{B programming language}, which was invented by Ken Thompson.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{The C Programming Language}
\begin{itemize}
    \item In 1971, Dennis Ritchie improved upon B and called it \textbf{New B}.
    \item By 1972, the changes were so significant that Ritchie renamed his new language the \textbf{C programming language}.
    \item Ken Thompson then rewrote the entire Unix operating system in C.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Spread of UNIX}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The C source code for Unix was distributed to universities and research centers for educational purposes.
    \item From 1975 onward, a very active community emerged around Unix and C.
    \item Other notable developers included:
          \begin{itemize}
              \item Douglas McIlroy (McElroy)
              \item Joseph Ossanna
              \item Rudd Canaday
          \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Key Milestones}
\begin{itemize}
    \item 1978: Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie published the book \textit{The C Programming Language}.
    \item 1983: Thompson and Ritchie received the \textbf{Turing Award}, the highest distinction in computer science, for their invention.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Legacy of UNIX}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The concepts introduced by Unix are ubiquitous today and form the foundation for many modern operating systems.
    \item Derivatives of Unix include:
          \begin{itemize}
              \item macOS
              \item iOS
              \item Android
              \item Linux, which is installed on the vast majority of today's servers and connected objects.
          \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Linux genesis and history: GNU, Stallman, GPL, Linus Torvalds, Linux}

\subsection{The GNU Project}
\begin{itemize}
    \item In 1983, the same year Ritchie and Thompson received the Turing Award, \textbf{Richard Stallman} of MIT launched the \textbf{GNU Project}.
    \item GNU is a recursive acronym standing for \textbf{GNU is Not Unix}.
    \item The project aimed to develop a free, open, and collaborative software system compatible with Unix, contrasting with the proprietary nature of Unix owned by Bell Labs.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Richard Stallman and the GPL}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Richard Stallman is a strong advocate for free and open-source software.
    \item In 1989, he conceived the \textbf{GNU General Public License (GPL)}, designed to preserve the freedom to use, study, modify, and distribute software.
    \item By 1990, the GNU Project had created many tools (text editors, GUI, libraries, and the \textbf{GNU C Compiler (GCC)}), but it lacked a free operating system kernel to run them on.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Linus Torvalds and the Linux Kernel}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Linus Torvalds}, a student at the University of Helsinki, was frustrated by proprietary OS licenses.
    \item On August 25, 1991, he announced a "free operating system" project (just a hobby) to the community.
    \item This became the \textbf{Linux kernel}, developed on an 80386 processor using the GNU C Compiler.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Integration and Growth}
\begin{itemize}
    \item A community formed quickly, integrating GNU software with the Linux kernel.
    \item In 1992, the first \textbf{Linux distributions} were released (Linux kernel + GNU tools).
    \item By 1993, there were over 100 developers, and popular distributions like \textbf{Debian} emerged.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Widespread Adoption}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Late 1990s:} Major manufacturers (Dell, IBM, HP) announced Linux compatibility.
    \item \textbf{2000s:} Increasing deployment on web servers.
    \item \textbf{2010s:} Linux and Unix-based systems dominated:
          \begin{itemize}
              \item Internet servers (~70\%)
              \item Smartphones (~90\%, via Android and iOS)
              \item Supercomputers (~99\%)
          \end{itemize}
    \item Linux is also prevalent in game consoles, routers, and IoT devices.
\end{itemize}

\section{Command line interface, prompt, command options and files data, command cal as example}

\subsection{Definition and Interaction}
\begin{itemize}
    \item A \textbf{Command Line Interface (CLI)} is a human-machine interface where communication takes place in text mode.
    \item The user types a command to request an operation, and the computer displays the result or further questions in text.
    \item It is central to the interaction between users and computing equipment.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{The Command Prompt}
\begin{itemize}
    \item When ready to receive input, the system displays a \textbf{command prompt}.
    \item This prompt usually contains information like the user's name, computer name, current directory, or date.
    \item It ends with a character such as \texttt{\$}, \texttt{\#}, or \texttt{>}.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Command Structure}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Unix and Linux systems include hundreds of simple applications usable from the CLI.
    \item The basic structure of a command is: \texttt{command options files\_or\_data}
    \item \textbf{Command:} The name of the application (often written in C).
    \item \textbf{Options:} Modify the command's execution (separated by spaces).
    \item \textbf{Files or Data:} The inputs for the program.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Example: The \texttt{cal} Command}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Typing \texttt{cal} and pressing Enter runs the application that displays a calendar.
    \item Adding the \texttt{-j} option (e.g., \texttt{cal -j}) displays the calendar in Julian days (number of days elapsed since January 1st).
\end{itemize}
